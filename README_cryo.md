# Platelet cryopreservation involves the addition of a cryoprotectant, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and freezing at −80°C. The structure and function of reanimated cryopreserved platelets differs significantly to normal fresh apheresis platelets. These alterations include a loss of functional platelet surface receptors, externalization of phosphatidylserine, shedding of microparticles, and inflammatory granule release. This dataset aims to model novel antifreeze glycoprotein peptides and their ability to prevent cryopreservation induced damage of Platelets. The cellular cryoprotection market is a US$4.6 billion dollar industry.
